Vs work to buy bike then ride it
Vs car 
Now what about 1 month? 3 months? 6 months?

Now what about North only
Now what about swimming only

The concepts still need work but the gist is essentially a broader scoping and interpretation of the 1:10:100 rule mentioned

You're a start-up following a north star metric (will refer to as pole star to avoid confusion).

You've got 1 year of runway left in your cash.

How do you optimize for excelling at your execution?

From a "distance traveled" analogy, we can consider this with different modes of transportation:

- Walking in a given direction for 1 year
- Building a bicycle (takes 2 weeks), and biking for 50 weeks
- Buying a bicycle (costs 1 week), and biking for 51 weeks
- Building a car (takes 2 months), and driving for 10 months
- Buying a car (costs 1.5 months), and driving 10.5 months

Now what if the car only can drive north, but you realize your pole star has shifted to south-east. Now you're back to square 1 and need to figure out what's next.

(analogous to investing time/energy into a platform that customers didn't want - and can't be reused)

What this concept is still missing:
- Needs better translation between "distance traveled" and a practical pole star example
    - Currently can only think of Find Work where I spent *so* much time designing then building, without enough time to sell/market
- Tight feedback loops are almost always preferred since you can build and build but it might be in the entirely wrong direction
