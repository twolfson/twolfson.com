# Analytics vendor selection
## Comparison
|      Vendor      |                                     Notes                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Google Analytics | Well established vendor, captures things well                                  |
| Heap             | Great resource for product analysis but overkill for a personal website        |
| Mixpanel         | Good for individual analysis, but that feels icky privacy-wise (esp with GDPR) |
|                  |                                                                                |

## Processing notes
### 2023-06-03
Google Analytics was our default choice when setting up this site. It was the most reputable option and easy to stand up.

[Google Analytics is shutting down their Universal Analytics solution][ga-switch] with Google Analytics 4, and instead of just jumping between solutions, I feel it's time to make intentional choices around vendors.
