Possible article if right: 
Sizing out PR 

Capture all possible moves. Try to keep orthogonal
Capture how many lines of code each. Maybe grep. Maybe read
Add in new lines for testing addition and deletion

Maybe something with 1000 lines of code total and 200-300 per PR requires at least 4 PR 
Note about trying to keep PR consistent. Eg if all rename. No sneak 1 line new behavior

More work upfront yes. But easier review and re review and bug catching

Another piece. Talking through inter step dependencies

Velocity is goal. No over document. Just run
