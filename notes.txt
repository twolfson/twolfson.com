Startup time investing. Velocity
Like squares of land with different friction levels
Or really edges in graph / road network

Might shift operational process note 

But it's about cleaning up tech debt. Aka Legos. To make turning the road easier in the future 
Or just never being developed. Like sand 

But also unpredictable. Foggy over there. Build exactly what you need
