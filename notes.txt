Prob too bespoke for broadly usable but maybe...?

Always have a plan first
Do the research to work through the plan
Walk through the screens
No screens? Talk to designer
No designer? Think through the UX and mock or prototype them out
    (mock vs prototype tradeoffs: time investment + longevity vs speed)
    (also considerations around UI framework but more discourse for another time)

Look through the code, consider all scenarios and edge cases
Still just planning
(need to tie back with prototyping somehow?)

Discuss scope creep or cutting + timeline requirements

Prioritize the plan

Execute the plan

Code review + landing process handwaving since bespoke to org and very very well documented
