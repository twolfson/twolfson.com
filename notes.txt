TLDR of hard to find in books
Avoid baseline grid
Focus on alignment and cross align ment 
Typographic scale still relevant
Grid types still relevant. Modular grid
Line length
Margins based on type size or leading
Typeface vs font 
Applied color. Color palette wide range of options for preference
Texture is key
Components of design. Line. Shape. Etc
Gestalt principles
Play important. Checking criteria as the process. Rather than formulaic
Snowtrack of course
Wild drawing improvements over 12 weeks
