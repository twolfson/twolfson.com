This year at Burning Man, I helped build another giant art piece. This time it was a giant upside down ice cream cone named [Cone Down][]

# Construction
Cone Down was built with a steel frame, layered like a cake

Each layer had either 8 or 16 panels where a lightbox would be mounted via bolts through tabs

Each lightbox is an aluminum sheet with LEDs directly mounted via mounting tape and corrugated plastic for its sides and/or top (depends on panel location)
