This year I helped built another large art piece, Cone Down. It was a 30' tall upside down ice cream cone with 5,110 LEDs, was climbable, had aerial performances, and had a dancefloor (with 441 additional LEDs)

**TODO: Add photos**

I'm going to skip the deep-dive of timeline, fabrication, build, and teardown as I feel it's spiritually similar to Rainbow Bridge (i.e. fabricate panels and frame, assemble frame on-site, mount panels)

Instead, I'd like to talk about my personal experience in what I experienced as a failure yet observers experienced as a success.
