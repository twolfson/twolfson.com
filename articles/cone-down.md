This year I helped built another large art piece, Cone Down. It was a 30' tall upside down ice cream cone with 5,110 LEDs, was climbable, had aerial performances, and had a dancefloor (with 441 additional LEDs)

**TODO: Add photos**

I'm going to skip the deep-dive of timeline, fabrication, build, and teardown as I feel it's spiritually similar to Rainbow Bridge (i.e. fabricate panels and frame, assemble frame on-site, mount panels)

Instead, I'd like to talk about my personal experience in what I experienced as a failure yet observers experienced as a success.

The summarized version is that after mounting all the panels, nothing lit up. Then after a lot of effort, about 70% of the cone lit up.

There are a bunch of factors that lead up to that point (e.g. manufacturer inconsistencies, misorientable connections, lack of integration testing, rushed timeline, difficult maintenance plan). The list can go on for a while and a lot of fingers can be pointed, however I'd like to discuss what I went through emotionally.

In short, I took it not lighting up 100% as a failure and due to being a lead, I took that as a personal failure.

However, as I interacted with more and more people who weren't on the project, it became clearer and clearer that nobody else saw the faults -- only the beauty in the finished piece. This was reaffirming and helped make the processing much easier.

When I zoom out, I can see this in a similar light in programming. There have been times when I've taken down the production site accidentally, which I perceive to be a major failure and work towards owning/fixing. On the outside though, if there aren't many active users or anyone else using a specific part of the site which broke, then the faults aren't perceived at all.

Now I'm not encouraging taking down a production site for kicks. However, maybe I won't beat myself up as hard when I break a minor part of the site (e.g. CSS alignment for a specific component).
