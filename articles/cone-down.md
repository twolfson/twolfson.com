This year at Burning Man, I helped build another giant art piece. This time it was a giant upside down ice cream cone named [Cone Down][].

# Construction
Cone Down was built with a steel frame, layered like a cake

Each layer had either 8 or 16 panels where a lightbox would be mounted via bolts through tabs



-------------

Each panel on the scoop and cone is built out of a lightbox. For simplicity, we decided to also use lightboxes for the dancefloor. Here's a visual explanation:

> For reference, the scoop and dancefloor panels used J channel with flat corrugated plastic screwed in on top.

> Only the cone panels (above) had corrugated plastic bent into a box.
