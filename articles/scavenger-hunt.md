# Startup engineering is a scavenger hunt
Rambly parts in my head I need to get down:

Twitter video of person jumping from video block to video block

Analogy is decent but not great

Scavenger hunt:

- Only learn about where you're going once you reach each checkpoint
- With experience, get a general trend of what's possible in the next round and have a trove of ideas for how to improve things
- But never truly know what's going to happen next

- Cynefin framework is insanely useful for figuring out strategies of what to do next
    - At some point, we start to use these strategies inherently (e.g. architectural documents to analyze target point and think through ways to get there, as well as discover landmines that would be done via a certain path -- in the scavenger hunt analogy, this would be laying out a route on a map)

- Like any analogy, this isn't perfect - but it's pretty damn good


- If we know we're only going across town, then going to a car dealership to buy a car is prob a waste of time right now
- but if we get a secret clue about us going across town now but then going 2 towns over and then to the edge of the county, getting a car sounds a lot better than walking

- what if we discover we need to go underwater all of a sudden?
- or what if we're transported to Jupiter where our tools are much harder to use with all the extra gravity? (read as a pivot)
  - TODO: Jupiter has extra gravity, yes?
