As the trope goes, I've built a lot with software and wanted to start pushing myself into the physical world.

I've been trying to do it on/off for many years (up until a few months ago, I still had an unused soldering iron from 6 years ago).

I think the issue was all the kits out there are recipe-based (i.e. here are these parts, wire them up like this, and we're done) and not concept/application based which is how I learn best.

I started to actually make progress when I saw this video from SparkFun:

It was akin to someone showing me [Firebug][] for the first time (or maybe using `window.alert()` before that). For the non-crusty folks, Firebug is the predecessor to all modern dev tools

With the knowledge about multimeters, I finally knew how to understand what was causing problems (e.g. voltages, continuity, determining resistance necessary)

I continued to built circuits on breadboards from recipe-like projects but was starting to understand concepts without being sheepish towards the circuit
