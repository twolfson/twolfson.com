I'm a startup engineer; 12 years as software engineer (mostly early stage), 3x first engineer (incl 1x founder), and former Uber engineer.

In this article, I will explain how every digital company has an analog equivalent, and how to progressively build a company out.

TODO: Image at top of article showing progression

# Analog and Digital Equivalents
Every digital company has an analog equivalent.

This is important because all intuitive actions originate from the analog version when we build their digital equivalents.

Some companies can be built progressively from analog to digital, others cannot (e.g. full buy-in required).

This is a complete encompasses all companies because fall into either [producing a good or providing a service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp).

TODO: Ensure we talk about goods somewhat

Let's talk through some examples:

## Online stores
Analog equivalents are physical storefronts (**service**) selling goods.

TODO: Show images of e-commerce

Actions include browsing items, adding items to your shopping cart, and checking out at the end.

For marketplaces (e.g. eBay, Etsy), the analog equivalent is more akin to a flea market (different vendors)

## Surgery
Not all analog services have digital equivalents.

Due to surgery being a physical interaction,

There can be applications on top of surgery (e.g. remote control) which are digital, but that's not surgery itself.

TODO: It turns out goods don't have a digital equivalent always for this same reason (was curious about actually thinking through this)
I need to rework this article to talk about how I've only ever built services
and how all of my experience/thinking is in services really

Keep getting hungry too... going to do something else until we eat, then come back later

TODO: Talk about produce as an obvious good

TODO: Initial notes:

"""
Article
Every digital system has analog equivalent
Talk through conversion
Manual MVP
Goods and services as maximal
(this is prob useful because it comes up regularly with building a startup, and somehow people miss obvious "always start with manual" step)
(possibly an addendum to "operational process" article)

Article title
Building a Company: Nothing to Analog to Digital

Talk through all past companies?

Goods and services

Tying it back to operational process
Do until hurts

"""

TODO: New notes, context: Trying to sort through defining a digital good
Conclusion was that analog <> digital is not quite the same as
and that companies often do both goods and services or just services, impossible for just goods
but my speciality is around service oriented companies and SaaS (which is that a good or not? just not hardware for sure)

2023-12-16:
No digital produce (food) from company. But real world intangible might qualify. Eg connection (social media friendship). No. Nope. Not a commodities. It's a service
--
File is a digital good. Like scan data. Obv bad without context but do is any physical good

Can build company producing them. Though that's a service

But what about standards and formats. Like rar.
--
Compression as example of analog good. But manual first
Like a proof

Small scale then large scale
--
Sanest reframing for article is prob Nothing to Manual to Automated
(but then dealing with "is this just Operational Processes but not?"
--
2023-12-17:
Every piece of software ever built I laid out in manual fashion
Trying to jump to the end immediately always lead to confusion in structure and getting lost
--
Technically can just lay out company structure and build it
Just not recommended/ideal since you lose ability to shift schema+workflow with an "Add column" action
Or revamp something entirely in 1 day (rewriting notes)
--
Restatement: The more built out system (code + users), the more difficult it is to change it (restructure + migrations)
"""

"""
2023-12-20: Talk about avoiding bubble and no or low code solutions unless WYSIWYG websites. But not apps (though really this feels like hearsay -- reason is you wind up taking time to build engineering esque, then rebuilding system again in code)
