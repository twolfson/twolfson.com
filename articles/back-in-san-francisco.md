It's been a while since I've had a last life/career related post so let's catch you up:

- Launched [Find Work][] at the end of February 2018
- There were some sales/partnership prospects but they fell through
- Continued to develop features but by the end of March 2018, I decided to commit to a full-time job search
    - It was hard to context switch between features, processing job listings, and handling interviews/phone screens
- At this point, I'd decided to move back to San Francisco
    - It was too exhausting to move to an unfamiliar city again with a chance of not liking it
    - I was open to living in San Francisco, Chicago, or Tokyo
    - Practically speaking though, San Francisco was the only long term option
        - Tokyo: Uncertain of Japanese working culture and lifestyle permanently
        - Chicago: Winters would become unbearable
- The job search continued but was moving slowly/frustratingly for a few reasons (I only got this insight towards the end of my search)
    - Being in Portland and flying to onsites in San Francisco, typically means 1 to 2 weeks lead time
    - I was often very relaxed in interviews which meant I didn't fully engage/seem excited despite honestly being so
- At the end of April 2018, I left Portland and moved back to San Francisco
- From late May through late July, I contracted at [Verbling][], an online language tutor marketplace
- In late July, I accepted an offer and started full-time at [Standard Cyborg][]
- I've remained at [Standard Cyborg][] since then and really enjoy it here
