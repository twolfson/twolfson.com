TODO: Alternative intro:
You're at a startup, you have a finite number of hours in a week. How do you determine what to build, what to prioritize, and what to even do?

-->

At a startup, there's a constantly competing list of tasks and priorities that occur organically through the process of running a business. These can vary wildly so I'm going to give a few examples:

[Underdog.io][], a curated job candidate <-> company marketplace, task list:

- Review new candidate applications
- Send out weekly batch of new candidates to companies
- Onboard accepted candidates
- Ensure accepted candidates are enjoying experience
- Sell to new companies
- Onboard new companies
- Ensure onboarded companies are enjoying experience
- Find any highly requested features
- Build said new features

[Underdog.io]: https://underdog.io/

This is a **very** reductive list of what we did at [Underdog.io][], and the list will vary significantly based on other companies (more examples at bottom TODO) but it's where we'll start.

One thing you'll notice that's not on this list, is how much time each of these tasks takes.

The nuance is that each of these tasks can be fast or slow depending on how much time has been invested in the process. **This is the nuance this article will be discussing.**

Not in the list but worth mentioning now:

- Building internal tools
- Building scripts
- Technical decisions as business decisions
- YAGNI again
- Hiring

In my last post (startup engineering lessons), from a long time ago, I'd mentioned building for run in a certain direction.

I've tried to strain this analogy more than it goes, and realized it's a different once entirely

It's more like a compass with many different directions (or like a spider chart if that's your thing)
