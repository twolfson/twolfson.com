I'm a startup engineer; 3x first engineer, former Uber engineer, and have worked at many more startups.

In this article, I cover how I prioritize operational work against business priorities.

There's an (un)written list of competing tasks and priorities that organically occur from running a startup. Here's an example for [Underdog.io][], a curated job candidate <-> company marketplace:

**Operational tasks:**

- Review new candidate applications
- Send out weekly batch of new candidates to companies
- Onboard accepted candidates
- Ensure accepted candidates are enjoying experience
- Sell to new companies
- Onboard new companies
- Ensure onboarded companies are enjoying experience

**Non-operational tasks:**

- Build feature X
- Improve
- I will provide more examples at the bottom (TODO)

[Underdog.io]: https://underdog.io/

In addition to this list, there's an evergrowing backlog of feature requests and improvements which can be made to these processes.

For each of these tasks, I give a priority weighting based on the following:

- How much time is spent on a task?
- How frequently do we expect to keep doing this task?
- How long do we expect to keep doing this task for?
- What value would we receive from completing this task?
- What would happen if we remove or stop doing the task?

The blueprint for how we can speed up a given task depends on a lot on the task, so I'm going to walk through various examples:

## Send out weekly batch of new candidates to companies
For a starting point, we're going to begin with the contrived worst-case MVP implementation for candidate batches:

> This is not how Underdog.io actually did things, we had the foresight to use Google Sheets as our initial database, thus foregoing the intermediary engineering steps.

-

- All data was written into a Google Sheet
  - TODO: See "Lessons of a startup engineer" for explanation why
- Candidate review occurrs within said Google Sheet
  - In practice, there was an internal tool built early on
- Candidates specify companies to not be sent to
- Batches are manually constructed for each company, pasted into email, peer reviewed, and sent

If you're reading this and feel like "this sounds like a really slow and error-prone proces", you'd be right!

In fact, this was one of my first tasks at Underdog.io ðŸ˜ƒ

> I should note that the Google Sheet actually simplified the process at this point.
>
> There could have been another version where the data was input into a database and an engineer would dump the data to a CSV for review, then load the data back in via a script

TODO: Talk through examples which cannot be automated as much (e.g. sales)

TODO: Delegation model:

- Eng -> Support -> Customer -> Support -> Eng
- Support -> Customer -> Support
- Customer

- One-off commands run via SQL / REPL
- One-off peer-reviewed script run via CLI
- Committed script run via CLI
- Committed script run via a button in an engineering only UI
- Committed script run via a button in operational tooling UI
- Self-serve action that user can take

- No storage vs localStorage vs DB save

- Manual review vs automated review for user-based input (e.g. ID verification)

- Heroku single server vs Digital Ocean single server vs Digital Ocean load balancer + multi-server vs multi-provider
  - Similarly deployment script

- Architecture: Monolith vs SOA vs micro-services
- Architecture: API + UI vs Monolith

There's a few ways we can speed up a given task:

- Automation
- Specialization
- Delegation
- TODO: Any others?

Not in the list but worth mentioning now:

- Building internal tools
- Building scripts
- Technical decisions as business decisions
- YAGNI again
- Hiring

TODO: Example lists as well for Find Work and Standard Cyborg

In my last post (startup engineering lessons), from a long time ago, I'd mentioned building for run in a certain direction.

I've tried to strain this analogy more than it goes, and realized it's a different once entirely

It's more like a compass with many different directions (or like a spider chart if that's your thing)
