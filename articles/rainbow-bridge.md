TODO: See TODOs

This year I helped build a giant rainbow for and at Burning Man. It was 70' x 30' x 4', had 25,200 LEDs, was walkable, and had aerial performances

Under construction:

Here's some more high level details:

- 7 large trusses, acting as the backbone of the bridge (3 of 7 in this photo)

- 3 days to pack everything onto a 53' flatbed and into large U-Haul (Thursday - Saturday)
- 2 days to drive to the desert (Sunday - Monday)
- 5 days to assemble and erect bridge (Monday - Friday)
- 4 more days to mount panels and fix electronics issues (Saturday - Tuesday)
- 15 people in on-site build crew with assistance from HEaT (Heavy Equipment and Transpo crew at Burning Man)
- Countless volunteers and hours leading up to that

So now for story time. What motivated me to contribute to such a project and what was my experience with it

# Motivations
> For those unfamiliar with Burning Man, it's a blank slate where people bring art and music to create a temporary city for 8 days
>
> For further reading, here's a lunch and learn presentation I gave about it: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1752fmM8tJgjFNEw0VnFdGHDjVNGsZ74Ofbg8H7lss_4/edit?usp=sharing

At the time of writing, I'm 29 years old and my dad would be 79 years old. He died earlier this year. I always had this desire to have kids before he passed away

Initially, I though this was due to wanting to have my children know their grandparents (I didn't have much of an experience here). Then after a speed counseling session at last year's Burning Man, I realized this wasn't the full case

> Burning Man story time! I didn't seek out speed counseling, more it found me -- as a lot of things do out there
>
> I was exploring a new part of the city. Someone offered me hot dogs, I accepted and stopped in. While eating and talking with my new friends, a woman invited me to speed dating
>
> I figured why not since I'd never done it before
>
> We went to the event, it turned out to be speed counseling but I decided to stick around anyway

Back to motivations, the epiphany I had at this speed counseling event was that half of my fear was rooted in being unable to teach my kids the content that my dad had taught me

One of these major fears being was lacking knowledge and practice with being handy

After getting back to San Francisco, I decided to properly address this. I had some EL wire that wasn't functioning properly. This was motivation enough to try to pick up electronics again for the nth time

Then in my dating life, someone told me about how Burning Man art projects are willing to teach you as long as you're willing to help. I was skeptical of said free lunch but I guessed I was giving free labor

In March, I went to a Burning Man theme camp and art project meet and greet and signed up for a few volunteer lists

Then in June, I was contacted by both Rainbow Bridge and Chilopod, another art project, about coming to their respective warehouses to help out

I went over to Rainbow Bridge first but there wasn't much for me to do yet; the majority of the project was metalwork which I wasn't qualified for. That being said, there was a prototype panel which needed wiring and soldering so I jumped on that

Rainbow Bridge felt low-touch for me at the time so I started helping out on the Chilopod which was wood fabrication. I added a lot of carpentry experience there: drills, impact drivers, circular saws, jigsaws, orbital sanders, and techniques (e.g. clamping with your body weight, proper weight/hold for drill/impact driver, accurate measurements over long distances)

Photos from Chilopod newsletter:

As time progressed, the Rainbow Bridge work also increased and I didn't have enough time for both projects so I went with Rainbow Bridge as it felt they were more lacking in volunteers
