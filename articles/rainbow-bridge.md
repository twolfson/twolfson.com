This year I helped build a giant rainbow for and at Burning Man. It was 70' x 30' x 4', had 25,200 LEDs, was walkable, and had aerial performances

- 3 days to pack everything onto a 53' flatbed and into large U-Haul (Thursday - Saturday)
- 2 days to drive to the desert (Sunday - Monday)
- 5 days to assemble and erect bridge (Monday - Friday)
- 4 more days to mount panels and fix electronics issues (Saturday - Tuesday)
- 15 people in on-site build crew with assistance from HEaT (Heavy Equipment and Transpo crew at Burning Man)
- Countless volunteers and hours leading up to that
